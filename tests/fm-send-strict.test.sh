# A send that cannot be tied to a recorded task/lane or to an explicit
# well-formed backend target must fail loudly. These tests pin the historical
# silent-fallback failures: missing FM_HOME, unresolved selectors, prefixless
# herdr pane ids, dead explicit endpoints, and the healthy exact/fm-id paths.
# They also verify that a key send reports whether delivery actually succeeded,
# and that the typed plane accounts for both of its submit verdicts out loud:
# the confirmed one it once reported with silence, and the unconfirmed one whose
# existing text and exit 3 must survive that addition.
